# Statistics: 101

## Intro

* Statistics: used by scientists to convert data into useful information
* This is a process, divided in three main stages:
  1. Producing Data
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Interpreting Data

## Definitions

* Population: entire group of interests, people objects, plants, etc.
* Sample: sub-set of the population.

* Data: information about individuals organized in variables
* Observation: particular unit of observation within the sample (e.g., person
  object)
* Variable: particular characteristics of the unit of observation
* Data set: set of data of individual observations and variables
* Codebooks: offer complete information regarding the data set
* Raw data: lists of numbers and labels, not very informative, lacks
  context

## Types of Variables

* Quantitative: take numerical numbers, represent a measurement (eg, age,
  weight).
* Categorical (Qualitative): take category or label values, place an
  observation in a group (e.g., race, gender)

* Also important:
  * Dummy codes: numbers used to represent categories (or labels), they
    have no arithmetic meaning.
  * Unique identifier: variable meant to distinctively define each
    unit of observation (e.g., serial numbers for objects, social security
    numbers for persons)
